# Front-end React.js Interface for Github API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project created as part of the TQI Bootcamp challenges, I created an interface for the Github API based on the Github Dark dimmed theme.

The project aims to use a fully componentized structure, styled components and react hooks.
